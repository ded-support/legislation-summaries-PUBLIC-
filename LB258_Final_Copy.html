  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>Legislative Bill 258, from the Nebraska Legislature, mandates the Nebraska Department of Labor to undertake specific responsibilities regarding the minimum wage. By October 15 each year, starting in 2026, the Department must calculate and publish the adjusted minimum wage rate. This adjustment will be based on a one and three-quarters percent increase and will take effect the following January 1. The bill does not mention changes to funding, appropriations, or budget allocations for the Department of Labor. The focus is instead on procedural duties related to the annual adjustment and publication of wage rates.</p>
