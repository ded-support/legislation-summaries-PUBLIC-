  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>Legislative Bill 34, introduced by Senators Hunt and Conrad, mandates the implementation of year-round daylight saving time in Nebraska, contingent upon certain federal authorizations and neighboring states&#x27; actions. The bill addresses time standardization by specifying that Nebraska&#x27;s time zones shall align with Coordinated Universal Time, pending authorization by U.S. laws or directives from the Secretary of Transportation. Furthermore, it prescribes adjustments for state employees, such as annual balancing of sick leave accounts and increased vacation leave entitlements through continued employment. Notably, the legislative bill tasks the Director of Personnel with establishing regulations for administering this section on state employee leave. Sections 49-1301, 49-1302, 81-1323, and 81-1328 are amended, while section 32-908 is repealed to harmonize existing provisions.</p>

  <h2>Underlined (Added) Text Summary</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>The legislative text outlines the standard time for the State of Nebraska, defining it as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) minus five hours for the central time zone and UTC minus six hours for the mountain time zone. The determination and interpretation of UTC for the United States are coordinated by the U.S. Secretary of Commerce and the U.S. Secretary of the Navy. The implementation of this subsection depends on authorization by U.S. law or orders from the U.S. Secretary of Transportation. Additionally, it requires three neighboring states to adopt similar year-round time standards. No changes to funding, appropriations, or budget allocations are mentioned in the added text.</p>
