This bill affects several government statutes, specifically amending Nebraska&#x27;s standard and daylight saving time practices. The sections amended include 49-1301, 49-1302, 81-1323, and 81-1328 of the Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, and section 32-908 of the Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement, 2024.

  <h2>Underlined (Added) Text Summary</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>The legislative bill introduces changes to the standard time observed in the State of Nebraska. It specifies that Nebraska will follow Coordinated Universal Time minus five hours in the central time zone and minus six hours in the mountain time zone. This alignment is to be maintained in coordination with the U.S. Secretary of Commerce and the U.S. Secretary of the Navy. Additionally, the changes will be enacted upon authorization by U.S. laws or orders from the U.S. Secretary of Transportation. Furthermore, these changes are contingent on three adjacent states adopting a single year-round standard of time. There is no mention of changes to funding, appropriations, or budget allocations in the added text.</p>
