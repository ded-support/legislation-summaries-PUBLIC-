  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>Legislative Bill 34 amends several sections of the Nebraska statutes to establish year-round daylight saving time, conditional upon authorization by U.S. law or Secretary of Transportation orders, and adoption by three neighboring states. The bill impacts time provisions primarily coordinated by the United States Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Navy concerning Coordinated Universal Time. It includes several related adjustments: Section 32-908 pertains to election polling times within Nebraska’s time zones, with opening and closing times specified according to each zone. Sections 81-1323 and 81-1328 address state employee policies, including adjustments to sick leave and vacation leave accrual, capping sick leave hours, and detailing vacation leave entitlements based on tenure. The legislation also mandates forfeiture of unused vacation within specified timelines, directing agency heads to facilitate leave usage, with detailed procedures for cash compensation of forfeited leave under specific conditions.</p>

  <h2>Underlined (Added) Text Summary</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>The legislative bill outlines that the standard time for Nebraska will be Coordinated Universal Time minus five hours in the central time zone and minus six hours in the mountain time zone. Coordinated Universal Time is maintained by the General Conference on Weights and Measures and adapted for the U.S. by the Secretary of Commerce, with coordination from the Secretary of the Navy. The subsection will take effect on the first Sunday in November under two conditions: authorization by U.S. laws or orders from the Secretary of Transportation, and if three neighboring states adopt a uniform year-round time standard. There are no specific changes to funding, appropriations, or budget allocations mentioned in the provided text.</p>
