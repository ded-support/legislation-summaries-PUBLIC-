  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>Legislative Bill 34 proposes changes to the time standards in Nebraska. The bill provides for year-round daylight saving time, contingent on federal authorization and similar legislative changes in three adjacent states. It amends existing statutes regarding the standard time, establishing it as Coordinated Universal Time minus five hours for the central time zone and minus six hours for the mountain time zone. The bill involves coordination with the United States Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Transportation. Additionally, there are amendments to time-related sections affecting state employee leave accounts, but no specific changes to budget allocations or appropriations are indicated in the document.</p>

  <h2>Underlined (Added) Text Summary</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>The added text specifies the standard time zones for Nebraska, aligning them with Coordinated Universal Time (UTC): UTC minus five hours for the central time zone and UTC minus six hours for the mountain time zone. The United States Secretary of Commerce, in coordination with the United States Secretary of the Navy, is responsible for interpreting or modifying this standard for the U.S. operations. Additionally, the provision is contingent on federal law or order from the United States Secretary of Transportation and three adjacent states adopting similar legislation for a uniform year-round time. There are no mentions of changes to funding, appropriations, or budget allocations.</p>
