  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>Legislative Bill 316 introduces several provisions relevant to the Department of Revenue. The bill mandates an excise tax of ten percent on the retail sale of cannabidiol products starting January 1, 2026. Retail sellers must maintain electronic records of sales as prescribed by the Department of Revenue and provide these records upon request. Retailers are required to file monthly returns with the department, reporting the total sales and tax amounts due, and may be obligated to file and pay electronically. The Department of Revenue is responsible for collecting this tax and ensuring it is credited to the Property Tax Credit Cash Fund, remitting payments to the State Treasurer. The department also retains authority for enforcing the compliance of retail sellers with these new requirements.</p>
