  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>Legislative Bill 135 (LB135) pertains to the conduct of elections in Nebraska, specifically addressing voting procedures for school district-related bond issues and financial measures. It involves several governmental bodies, including school boards, election commissioners, county clerks, and governmental units like educational service units. The bill amends procedures to align with Section 32-559, requiring bond and levy issues to be considered during elections that meet specified compliance criteria. It sets forth directives for budgetary measures, prohibiting governmental units from exceeding budget growth limits without voter approval. The bill permits a one-time budget exceedance by direct voter approval, either via a special election or a public meeting of residents, without altering existing restricted funds. Notably, the bill mandates electoral approval before issuing new bonds by joint entities including school districts or educational service units. Additionally, LB135 repeals Section 10-703.01 of the Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska.</p>

  <h2>Underlined (Added) Text Summary</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>The amendment outlines procedures for school district elections concerning bond issuance, property tax levies, or tax levy increases. These elections are to comply with certain subdivisions and take place in alignment with state or local general elections. The school board must file or certify the issue by specified deadlines, and the election commissioner or county clerk will conduct the election. Ballot notices need to be mailed and published, but not posted by the election officials. Early voting ballots must be prepared 21 days prior, and all counted ballots are returned to the school board for canvassing. Additionally, two impartial persons are appointed to assist with the ballot counting, compensated at minimum wage. The election process becomes a coordinated effort involving multiple counties when applicable. The legislation specifies procedural responsibilities but doesn&#x27;t mention changes to funding or appropriations.</p>
