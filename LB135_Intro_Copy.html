  <h2>Underlined (Added) Text Summary</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>The legislative additions specify election procedures for school district-related matters, such as bond issuance, property tax levy approval, or exceeding tax levy limits. Elections must comply with subsection (3) of section 32-559, and generally occur during statewide primary or general elections, or in odd-numbered years during regular political subdivision elections. The school board is responsible for filing the ballot order and certifying questions by set deadlines: March 1 for primaries and September 1 for general elections. County election commissioners or clerks conduct these elections, handle early voting arrangements, and count ballots with appointed disinterested persons. They must provide notice of elections and publish sample ballots in local newspapers. Furthermore, no funding, appropriations, or budget allocations are mentioned in the added provisions.</p>
