  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>Legislative Bill 135, introduced in the Nebraska Legislature, proposes amendments to various statutes concerning elections and funding processes associated with school districts and other governmental entities. Key agencies affected include school boards, educational service units, election commissioners, and county clerks. The bill modifies the procedures for submitting bond and budget questions to voters, dictating compliance with detailed election requirements specified in section 32-559. It also addresses budgetary constraints and taxation powers for governments, particularly around bond issuance and applicable voter approval mechanisms. Notable changes include the delineation of responsibilities for election preparations and funding, as well as conditions under which local government units can adjust their budgetary and bonding capacities, ensuring alignment with electorate decisions and statutory constraints. Additionally, the bill repeals section 10-703.01, related to outdated election procedures.</p>

  <h2>Underlined (Added) Text Summary</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>The legislative additions involve amendments regarding school district elections, particularly when proposing bonds, property tax levies, or exceeding levy limitations. Elections must comply with subsection (3) of section 32-559. The primary agencies involved are the election commissioner and county clerk, who are responsible for various election procedures, including counting ballots and coordinating early voting. The school board must certify election questions by specific dates for elections held in conjunction with primary or general elections. Notice of the election is given via first-class mail and published in newspapers, but not required from election commissioners or clerks. Ballots for early voting must be prepared 21 days prior to the election, and the elections are consolidated under one jurisdiction if the school district spans multiple counties. No changes to funding, appropriations, or budget allocations are mentioned in this summary.</p>
