  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>Legislative Bill 135 amends various sections of the Nebraska statutes to update processes involving elections, with a focus on propositions related to school district funding and governance. The bill involves changes impacting the conduct of elections under the purview of the Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee. Key provisions include clarifications and modifications in the procedures for submitting election issues by political subdivisions, particularly school districts, which must comply with new notice requirements and election arrangements as outlined in subsection (3) of section 32-559. It outlines the processes and conditions under which school districts can propose bond issues, alterations in tax levies, or budget expansions to voters. It mandates that such propositions are subject to a majority vote by qualified electors during elections, which could occur at primary, general, or special elections. Importantly, the bill also repeals section 10-703.01, eliminating certain statutory content.</p>
