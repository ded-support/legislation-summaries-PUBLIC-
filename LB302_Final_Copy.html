  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>Legislative Bill 302, introduced in the Nebraska Legislature, mandates significant changes regarding time observation in the state. It proposes the elimination of daylight saving time, with the harmonization of related statutes across sections 49-1301, 49-1302, 81-1323, and 81-1328 of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska. The bill does not specify any changes in funding or budget allocations for government agencies. The implementation of this change is contingent upon neighboring states—namely Iowa, Kansas, South Dakota, and Wyoming—adopting similar legislation to exempt from daylight saving time provisions. The bill addresses technical and procedural adaptations for state elections, such as polling and time zone management, but does not directly impact state agency funding or administrative budgets.</p>

  <h2>Underlined (Added) Text Summary</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>The added text in the legislative bill specifies that the State of Nebraska will standardize its time according to the Uniform Time Act of 1966 for both central and mountain time zones. However, Nebraska will exempt itself from observing daylight saving time and the associated provisions of 15 U.S.C. 260a(a), contingent upon similar legislative actions by Iowa, Kansas, South Dakota, and Wyoming. No government agencies or departments are directly mentioned in these changes, and there are no explicit updates related to funding, appropriations, or budget allocations. The implementation of this measure is dependent on the collective adoption by the specified neighboring states.</p>
