  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>Legislative Bill 302 proposes to eliminate daylight saving time in Nebraska, amending several state statutes. The bill specifically exempts Nebraska from observing daylight saving time as defined by the Uniform Time Act of 1966, contingent on similar actions by neighboring states Iowa, Kansas, South Dakota, and Wyoming. The State of Nebraska, operating within central and mountain time zones, will maintain standard time throughout the year without the annual advancement of time. </p>
<p>Additionally, the bill amends sections concerning employee leave management for state employees, involving sick and vacation leave. Section 81-1323 deals with the sick leave account, while section 81-1328 addresses vacation leave entitlements, accrual, and use for state employees, including provisions for payment upon separation from employment. No specific changes to funding, appropriations, or budget allocations are detailed in the bill.</p>

  <h2>Underlined (Added) Text Summary</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>The legislative bill adds a condition that the State of Nebraska shall not observe daylight saving time, following the Uniform Time Act of 1966 in both central and mountain time zones. This change is conditional upon Iowa, Kansas, South Dakota, and Wyoming adopting similar laws not to observe daylight saving time. The provision will take effect on January 1 of the year after all these states comply. It will become null and void if another specific condition, not detailed here, becomes operative in section 49-1301. There are no explicit mentions of government agencies, departments, or changes to funding, appropriations, or budget allocations in the added text.</p>
