  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>Legislative Bill 302, introduced in the One Hundred Ninth Legislature of Nebraska, aims to amend several sections of the Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska and the Revised Statutes Cumulative Supplement. Notably, the bill proposes the elimination of daylight saving time (DST) in the state, contingent upon similar legislative changes in Iowa, Kansas, South Dakota, and Wyoming. DST would cease to be observed once these states adopt similar laws and gain exemption from the provisions of 15 U.S.C. 260a(a), which allows for time advancement. Changes in standard time management would affect statewide election timing as managed by respective provisions of the Uniform Time Act of 1966. Additionally, updates to sick leave and vacation leave regulations for state employees are included, overseen by the Director of Personnel, without specifying new appropriations or budget reallocations.</p>

  <h2>Underlined (Added) Text Summary</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>The legislative bill relates to the State of Nebraska&#x27;s observance of time under the Uniform Time Act of 1966, specifically concerning daylight saving time. The bill stipulates that Nebraska will not observe daylight saving time and will be exempt from the related provisions of 15 U.S.C. 260a(a). This change will only take effect on January 1 of the year following when Iowa, Kansas, South Dakota, and Wyoming also pass laws opting out of daylight saving time. No specific government agencies or departments are directly mentioned in the added text, and there are no changes to funding, appropriations, or budget allocations indicated.</p>
