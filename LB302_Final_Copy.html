  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>Legislative Bill 302 proposes to eliminate daylight saving time in Nebraska. It requires the standard time in both the central and mountain time zones to align with the Uniform Time Act of 1966, exempting Nebraska from observing daylight saving time, as specified under 15 U.S.C. 260a(a). This change will only be enacted when Iowa, Kansas, South Dakota, and Wyoming also pass similar legislation. No explicit appropriations or funding changes are mentioned. Among the sections amended, Section 32-908 specifies election polling hours, and Sections 81-1323 and 81-1328 detail adjustments to state employee leave policies, particularly vacation leave, but do not indicate any budgetary impacts. The bill repeals specified sections of the Nebraska statutes to align with these changes.</p>

  <h2>Underlined (Added) Text Summary</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>The legislative bill specifies that the State of Nebraska will adhere to the standard time established by the Uniform Time Act of 1966 for both the central and mountain time zones but will not observe daylight saving time. Nebraska&#x27;s exemption from observing daylight saving time under 15 U.S.C. 260a(a) is contingent upon Iowa, Kansas, South Dakota, and Wyoming also enacting similar laws to abandon daylight saving time observance. No specific government agencies or departments are mentioned, and there are no changes to funding, appropriations, or budget allocations identified in the added text. The provision becomes operative on January 1 of the year following the adoption of such laws by all the listed states.</p>
